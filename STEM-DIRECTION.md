## Proposed leading README description (verbatim)

The stem is composed of mcus that maintains the system cohesion even when inactive. They take on
specific roles that make up the overall functionality. A SoM/SoC is the default master on the stem
bus and the work horse for the active system.

Defined roles for mcus are:
- **Sleep supervisor**
- **Power supply**
- **Inner vision** (nfc and super low res ir ml vision)
- **Radio receiver** (ble/thread)

The msp-fw will become the **stem repo** with firmware for all stem mcus. We need proper **HAL** to
manage the exact mcu models.

## Role → MCU (current fills)

| Role | Production chip | Core | Dev board |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sleep supervisor** (a.k.a. **Detector**) | MSP430 (FR2355 canonical; FR2433 baseline) | MSP430 | FR2476 / FR2355 LaunchPad |
| **Power supply** | **CYPM1111** | Cortex-**M0** | **CY7111** |
| **Inner vision** (NFC + super-low-res IR ML vision) | **RP2350** | — | — |
| **Radio receiver** (BLE / Thread) | **nRF52 family** | — | nRF52 dongle |

*Sleep supervisor ≡ **Detector** (Henrik, 2026-09-25): it uses sensors to determine what/how the device
needs to respond. "Detector" names the function (sense → decide response); "sleep supervisor" names the
when (active while the system sleeps).*

Each role has a **production chip** and (where applicable) a **dev board** used to develop it — the
same split as MSP430's FR2476 LaunchPad (dev) → FR2433/FR2355 (production). For the power role that's
**CY7111 (dev board) → CYPM1111 (the actual chip we would use)**.

Not starting the non-MSP430 parts yet — these are the current assignments. "Proper HAL to manage the
exact mcu models" is what lets one Stem repo hold firmware per role across these different cores/
vendors; it is a **later, incremental** step (extract it as the MCUs land, not ahead of them — the
near-term MSP430 step is FR2355 via a feature-gated PAC alias, see
[diag/FR2355-SCOPE.md](diag/FR2355-SCOPE.md)).

### MSP430 roles — FR2355 sleep-supervisor, FR2433 general I/O expander

FR2355 fills the **sleep-supervisor** role. A second MSP430 role — **"some sort of general I/O expander
on a daughterboard"** (Henrik, 2026-09-25, **not yet clearly defined**) — is an **even better fit for
the FR2433**: single-I²C, slave-only, already the **Stembus Expander** (a pure I/O-extender the SoM
drives), whereas FR2355's **2× I²C** (sensor master + SoM slave) is what suits the *autonomous*
sleep-supervisor. These map onto the prod firmware's existing behaviours — **Sensing** ≈ autonomous
supervisor (FR2355) and **Passive** ≈ pure I/O-extender/slave (FR2433 expander); see
[prod/DESIGN.md](prod/DESIGN.md). The daughterboard I/O-expander would use the semantic (topic,
topic-pin) model above. **To define:** what the daughterboard I/O-expander role adds beyond the
existing FR2433 Stembus Expander.

## Bench/dev host — RP2040 deep bus-inspection module (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-30)

> **New Stem member, the first non-MSP430 core to land.** Distinct from the **RP2350** "Inner vision"
> product node in the role table above — this **RP2040** is a **master/host** (a dev SoM stand-in),
> not a slave node.

Verbatim (Henrik 2026-09-30):

> *"I want to add an RP2040 profile for putting a dev-time firmware on it via USB. I want it to connect
> to both Leaf and Stem I2C and possibly also SPI. This isn't the role/variant that we might put in
> products but more of a dev-time that can be used to deep inspect internal busses. It would have access
> to the full stem bus including PMIC/boot pins for UCM i.MX 8M Plus, and other internal pins. This might
> be a dev/debug module that can be slotted into products for deep tests. It will start out as something
> for bench testing MCUs and sensors."*

And the recurring structural principle (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-30):

> *"I again want a prod base that can grow into something used in the products."*

And the purpose — an M7 stand-in for automated testing (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-30):

> *"This new firmware will allow you to run ad-hoc and soak tests fully automated without an attached
> UCM board directly from a Mac or Linux machine duplicating what the UCM SoM M7 will be able to do
> mastering the system."*

**Derived (not verbatim), for planning — reconciles with the `prod`-baseline principle above:** even
though the RP2040's *initial use* is a dev/bench bus inspector, its firmware is structured as a proper
**prod base** (foundation) with the dev/inspection capability layered on top — the same "prod is the
normal baseline; the test/dev harness is a build axis on top" stack proven for MSP430, so it's
product-quality and can grow (including possibly shipping as an in-product slotted debug module). The
RP2040 is the **master** side of the SAME chip-agnostic contracts the MSP430 nodes serve as slaves
(`regmap`, the stembus protocol, the semantic Stem/Leaf bus roles) — so it reuses those contracts, but
needs its **own** `board`/`hal` layer (Cortex-M0+, `thumbv6m`, a Rust RP2040 HAL) since it shares no
silicon with MSP430. This is the moment "proper HAL to manage the exact mcu models" (above) starts to
be real — extract cross-core abstractions **as this second core lands**, not ahead of it.

**The defining purpose = a UCM SoM M7 stand-in for host-driven automated testing.** The RP2040 masters
the stem system exactly as the i.MX 8M Plus's real-time **M7** core will, so **fully-automated ad-hoc +
soak tests run from a Mac/Linux machine (and CI) with NO UCM attached** — and, because it duplicates
the M7's mastering role, the test behaviour transfers to the real M7. This makes the stem system
testable in CI without a UCM in the loop (ties to the Big Bob bench / CI-hardware objective). Design
consequence: the host's capability set (`host-core`) should mirror the **M7's intended stembus-master
API**, so the same test harness can target the RP2040 (bench/CI) or the real M7 (on a UCM). See the
design doc [docs/RP2040-BENCH-HOST.md](docs/RP2040-BENCH-HOST.md).

### Structural direction across MCUs (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-30)

> 1. *"special debug firmware makes sense in a special location. prod crates do not"*
> 2. *"I start with RP2040, but will surely use RP2350 in the future"*
> 3. *"I will likely use Arducam TinyML board with a camera. This could be a dev base for something we
>    put in a product"*
> 4. *"Common crates should be common. We don't want duplication of crates that can be common. We don't
>    want forced commons that is full of if statements"*
> 5. *"You want to pick toolchain for building carefully so we can also add in nRF52 modules in the
>    future"*

**Derived synthesis (not verbatim) — the structure these imply:**
- **The shared surface is THIN, and consistency comes from COMMON TESTS, not shared code (4; Henrik
  2026-09-30: *"I can imagine the shared surface between the major families to be quite limited"* ·
  *"organise it as common tests across islands but no shared code. The bit that is common could be just
  duplicated, but kept in check with common tests"*).** The common bit — the **protocol/contract**
  (regmap + stembus line semantics) — is **small** and crosses language/runtime boundaries (Rust-sync
  MSP430, Rust-async RP/nRF, **C** CYPM1111), so a shared Rust crate can't span it anyway (the C island
  would port/duplicate regardless). Chosen model:
  - **One canonical spec** = [I2C-API.md](I2C-API.md) + the PCA9698 tables (the single source of truth;
    `regmap.rs` is already *derived* from it — keep it that way).
  - **Each island implements it itself** (its own language/runtime) — **duplication by design**, not a
    forced common crate.
  - **A common conformance suite keeps them honest** — and we already have the tester: the **RP2040
    host** masters every node, so the "common tests across islands" ARE the host's ad-hoc/soak suite
    driving each island's slave surface against the spec, plus shared **test vectors** (data, not code)
    an island's own unit tests can run. CI gates on conformance. (Tradeoff: duplication drifts if the
    suite misses a case — so "passes the conformance suite" *is* the definition of conformant.)
  - **Same-language device-driver overlap** (e.g. a sensor the Detector and the host both read) MAY
    still be a shared Rust crate if a real overlap lands, but default to the same duplicate-plus-test
    discipline; extract-on-proven-overlap still governs, just with a higher bar for shared *code*.

  Everything else is **per family**: runtime/framework (embassy async vs MSP430 sync-poll vs CYPM1111
  C), HAL, board/pins, feature logic. Even `crates/sched` is **island-side** (MSP430) — embassy nodes
  use embassy's executor. **Principle: the spec + the conformance suite are the common denominator;
  shared code is the exception, never the mechanism for consistency.**

### Public master-side client — the `stembus` client for the M7 (Zephyr) & the host (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-30)

> *"I would also imagine that stem repo would include a public crate/lib that can be used by the repo
> building M7 Zephyr based firmware."*

**Derived — this sharpens the master/slave split (the ONE place shared code is warranted):**
- **Slave side (the nodes):** many, constrained, divergent (MSP430 · CYPM1111 · …) → **duplicate +
  conformance-test** (above). No shared slave code.
- **Master side (the SoM/**M7** · the RP2040 stand-in · the Mac/Linux CI harness):** few, capable, and
  they *want* parity — so a **shared, public master client** earns its keep. The stem repo **publishes**
  a stable, versioned **`stembus` client** (scan nodes, read/write regmap, sequence control lines) — the
  portable master protocol logic, abstracted over a **transport**: local I²C for the M7/host;
  remote-over-USB for the Mac/Linux harness (talking *through* the RP2040 host).
- **Bindings (depends on the M7 repo's language, decided when it starts):** a **Rust crate** (RP2040
  host + CI harness + any Rust-on-Zephyr) and a **C library / Zephyr module** for mainstream C Zephyr.
  Both derive from the canonical spec and are kept honest by the **same conformance suite** — so this
  shared code does NOT reintroduce drift.
- **Payoff + discipline:** the RP2040 host's `host-core` **is** this client (concrete transport = its
  own I²C); the M7 uses the same client → "the RP2040 duplicates what the M7 does" becomes *literal*
  and the ad-hoc/soak tests transfer to the real M7. This is the one crate with **public-API
  discipline** (semver, docs, stability) — an **external repo depends on it**, unlike internal firmware.
- **Per-arch HAL/board crates stay SEPARATE, never cfg-merged across unrelated silicon (2,4):** MSP430
  `bsp` (msp430-hal) · a `rp-bsp` covering **RP2040 + RP2350** (a chip axis *within* the RP family,
  the same idea as the MSP430 family axis) · a future `nrf-bsp`. Each exposes the semantic bus roles
  (`stem_i2c`/`leaf_i2c`/`console`/`spi`) + embedded-hal, so the common layer stays chip-agnostic. This
  is exactly the "common is common; forced if-riddled commons are not" line: share the contract, keep
  the silicon separate.
- **Toolchain/framework = `embassy` for the parts it supports (2,5):** the one async framework
  spanning **RP2040 / RP2350 / nRF52** (embassy-rp, embassy-nrf), unified by embedded-hal(-async) —
  what (5) "add nRF52 later" + (4) "don't duplicate" jointly point to (one framework, not per-chip
  ecosystems). Targets: `thumbv6m` (RP2040), `thumbv8m.main-eabihf` (RP2350-ARM), `thumbv7em-eabihf`
  (nRF52). Async is a real tradeoff vs the MSP430 polled style, accepted for the ARM-side unification.
- **TWO non-embassy islands — MSP430 and the CYPM1111 (Power role) (2,4):** `embassy` is NOT a
  universal target. **MSP430** (msp430-hal) is one island; the **CYPM1111** (Power-supply role;
  Cortex-**M0**, `thumbv6m`, dev board CY7111) is another — a Cypress/Infineon part (PMG1/PSoC-class,
  ModusToolbox/C-first) that embassy does not cover (whether it has any Rust HAL at all = **verify when
  the Power role starts**; may be C-only). Consequence: **the sharing boundary sits BELOW embassy** —
  on `embedded-hal` + the **pure contract crate** — so the common crates (`crates/stembus`,
  `crates/devices`) **must not depend on embassy**, letting both islands share them. embassy is a
  framework choice for RP/nRF, never the common denominator.
- **The CYPM1111 is a planned stem NODE, and it forces the contract to be language-neutral (2,4):**
  the Power role is a node on the stembus — it serves the **same `regmap`/stembus contract as a slave**
  (the triplet: `stem_i2c` slave, its own `leaf_i2c`, `console`), so the RP2040 host + the shared
  contract reach it exactly like an MSP430 node. But because it's likely **C (ModusToolbox)**, the
  contract **cannot be Rust-only**: its **canonical source stays language-neutral** — the register map
  is already *derived* from [I2C-API.md](I2C-API.md) + the PCA9698 spec (see `prod/src/regmap.rs`'s
  header), so `crates/stembus` (Rust) and a generated **C header** are two *bindings* of the one spec.
  Sharing is therefore at the **protocol level** across all four groups: embassy-Rust nodes (RP/nRF),
  the MSP430 island, and the CYPM1111 C island. (This also anchors the field-update scheme — the
  CYPM1111's **row-based flash** is the granule, see §"Field-updatable firmware".)
- **Debug firmware lives in a SPECIAL location; prod crates do not (1):** the RP bench/bus-inspector
  (M7-stand-in) **binary** is segregated (e.g. a top-level `debug/` or `bench/`), built **on** the
  normal prod + common crates — but prod/product-capable crates never live in the debug area.
- **Boards incl. Arducam (3):** `rp-bsp` models boards as **(chip, module)** — a Pico-class bench host
  **and** the **Arducam TinyML + camera** board, the latter a dev base for a product (the **Inner
  vision** role, RP2350 in the table above). Same (chip, module, node-role) granularity as MSP430.

## Field-updatable firmware & integrity — FUTURE MILESTONE (verbatim)

> **Deferred.** Henrik (2026-09-25): *"I will return to this topic in a future milestone."* Not now —
> captured so it's not lost.

The firmware build includes **checksums** and may be **aligned to row boundaries** to allow partial
updates. When booting the firmware calculates the checksums and compare with expected. If it fails
the loading is **restricted to known working parts**.

Goal: **Stem firmware field-updatable with check-summed incremental updates.** The **CYPM1111 has row
logic** (row-based flash) that we would use for the **incremental field updates** — this is why images
align to **row boundaries** (a row is the update granule). This applies across the Stem MCUs, not just
CYPM1111.

**Decision (Henrik, 2026-09-25): A/B is NOT the approach** — common, but concluded against it. *"We
will make a custom scheme if need be, but attempt to ground any logic in what has been done before."*
So: a **custom scheme is acceptable** where warranted; ground it in **proven OSS solutions and
principles** as much as possible (checksum/signature verification, verify-then-boot, known-good
fallback) **without adopting A/B**. Note the model here is **row-granular incremental** updates (patch
rows, via the CYPM1111 row logic) — inherently different from A/B's whole-image swap.

## The full stembus (verbatim)

The full stembus for the som to communicate with mcus, is **i2c, uart, reset, bootsel, wakeup,
sleepy**.

It allows the som to connect to a specific mcu and **program or monitor it over uart or swd**. Some
lines are guarded by a **directional level shifter that can be switched on/off via the i2c**.

## Stem & Leaf I²C buses (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-29)

There are **two I²C buses**, named by role, not by silicon instance:

- **Stem I²C** — the SoM↔MCU interconnect (part of the stembus above). The MCU is a **slave/node**
  on it; the SoM is master.
- **Leaf I²C** — the bus carrying **leaf nodes**. Henrik: *"Leaf is a better name for the bus with
  sensors as it can also have LCD and other non-MCU nodes."* So it is **not** just "sensor I²C":
  sensors, LCDs, and any other **non-MCU** peripheral hang off it. The MCU is **master** here.

**The allocation of Stem vs Leaf to a physical eUSCI instance + pins is chip/PAC-specific.** So code
must not reference a raw peripheral like `e_usci_b0`; the **semantic bus (Stem/Leaf) is defined per
chip in the `board` layer** and exposed by role (e.g. `board::leaf_i2c()` / `board::stem_i2c()`),
exactly like the backchannel UART instance. The generated svd2rust PAC stays pure silicon
(`e_usci_b0`/`b1`); the *role→instance* mapping lives in `board`. On a 2-eUSCI-B part (e.g. FR2355:
UCB0 + UCB1) one becomes Leaf-master, one Stem-slave; on a slave-only part (FR2433) there is only the
Stem side. See [[per-sensor-module-convention]], [[prod-fw-multimodel-dualbus]].

### Granularity of `board` (decided · Henrik 2026-09-29)

**`board` = the module / PCB** — not the MCU (below it) and not the assembled product (above it).
Rationale, verbatim: *"We generally don't have more than one MCU per module. If we were to have two,
it would most likely be very different ones."* So a module carries **one MCU**, and `board` = that
module. Vocabulary: *"Modules are boards of sorts, or built around one. A sub-module can also be
thought of as a daughter board."* — module ≈ board; a **sub-module = a daughterboard**; all one layer.

Three layers: **chip/MCU** (silicon: PAC, clock trim, timer, RAM, eUSCI existence + pin options) →
**board/module** (which pins are wired; the semantic peripheral map: `leaf_i2c`/`stem_i2c`/
`console_uart`/`spi`) → **product/assembly** (which modules + MCU roles compose the device — the stem
topology). Because a module is ~1:1 with its MCU, the chip and board facts are **fused in one
`board::<chip>_<module>` file** (e.g. `fr2355_launchpad`) rather than split into separate `chip`/
`board` layers — the split is only forced if one MCU ever lands on ≥2 modules. The cargo feature names
the **chip** (the PAC axis); the module is named in the file. See [[stem-nervous-system-vision]].

**This generalizes to the whole node (Henrik 2026-09-29): `board` is the semantic peripheral map —
2× I²C, UART, SPI are all semantic.** Every bus is named by role and bound per-chip to its instance +
pins + mode: Stem-I²C (slave), Leaf-I²C (master), the backchannel/Stem UART, and SPI (e.g. an LCD or
non-MCU node). On MSP430 the allocation is constrained by silicon: **eUSCI_A = UART or SPI**,
**eUSCI_B = SPI or I²C** (SLAU445/SLAU144), and A/B counts + pinouts differ per part — which is exactly
why the role→instance map must be per-chip in `board`, and the layers above (`hal`/drivers) stay
role-agnostic.

**Every MCU node carries the same triplet (Henrik 2026-09-29):** `stem_i2c` (uplink to the SoM — the
MCU as **slave**), `leaf_i2c` (its **own** sensor/LCD/non-MCU subtree — the MCU as **master**), and
`console_uart` (debug/programming link). `stem_i2c` is needed **in addition to** `leaf_i2c`, not
instead of it.

**Multi-MCU boards need the node role as a disambiguator.** If a module has >1 MCU, `console_uart`
and `stem_i2c` exist **once per MCU** (both connect to the SoM), so the bus role alone is not unique —
you must qualify by **which MCU**, i.e. its **system role** (Detector, Expander, …). So the full
identity is `<node-role>::<bus-role>` (e.g. `detector.stem_i2c`, `expander.console_uart`), and the
**`board` granularity refines to (chip, module, node-role)** — the role is implicit on a single-MCU
module, explicit when >1. This is the same node identity the stembus uses (source chip / uid, above).
Physical consequence: **Stem-I²C is one shared bus with a distinct slave address per node**;
**console_uart is a separate link per node**; **leaf_i2c is a separate master subtree per node** (never
two masters on one bus). From a node's own firmware the accessors (`board::stem_i2c()` etc.) always
mean *this* node — the role qualifier lives in the system/topology layer and the SoM's addressing.

## diag and prod are variants, not separate codebases (verbatim · Henrik 2026-09-29)

*"I need both diag and prod to follow the same patterns and use the same abstractions. They are not
conceptually different code bases. Rather they should be variants in a dimension. Features of prod are
features of diag. Features in prod are API centric with occasional timer triggered activity. Features
in diag are tested/used one at a time to test presence, correctness, load/stress."*

So **diag and prod are two variants along one dimension**, over a **shared** feature set + abstractions,
not two codebases:
- A **feature** (a sensor/device, a bus, a subsystem) is implemented **once**, on the shared
  abstractions (`board` semantic peripheral map, `hal`, `crates/devices`). See
  [[per-sensor-module-convention]] — one module per sensor, both faces, no fork.
- **prod** = the **API-centric** variant: features driven by the stembus **API** (the SoM as master)
  with **occasional timer-triggered** activity. An event/API loop.
- **diag** = the **test** variant: the **same** features exercised **one at a time** to check
  **presence, correctness, load/stress**. A sequential test harness.
- **Feature containment:** every prod feature is a diag feature (prod ⊆ diag); diag additionally holds
  test-only modes (stress/soak). The *implementations* are shared; only the **harness** differs
  (API+timer vs one-at-a-time test) — so diag/prod become thin harnesses over shared crates
  (`board`, `hal`, `devices`, feature modules), not parallel trees.

Implication for the current work: the `board`/`hal` abstractions being built in `diag/` must land in a
**shared crate** both consume — this is exactly what `hal.rs` already anticipates ("when the board
crate lands, this type moves there"). The dual-target (chip) dimension and this diag/prod (harness)
dimension are orthogonal axes over the same shared code.

**prod is a LAYER diag builds ON (Henrik 2026-09-29):** *"I would also include prod code in diag so it
can be treated as a layer to build on. We would want to test the maximum amount of prod code in the
diag logic."* So the relationship is a **stack, not two siblings**: prod's real logic (features, API
handlers, timer behaviour) is factored into a **prod-core library**; the **prod binary** is a thin main
(the API+timer event loop) over it; and **diag depends on prod-core** and drives its features
one-at-a-time (+ test-only stress/soak). The point is **coverage**: diag exercises the **actual prod
code**, not a parallel reimplementation, so the maximum prod surface is under test.
- Stack: `bsp` (board/hal) + `devices` → **prod-core** (feature/API/timer logic) → { **prod bin** =
  thin event loop · **diag** = test harness driving prod-core }.
- **Requirement this imposes:** prod-core features/API-handlers must be **individually invocable** (a
  callable capability), not buried in the event loop, so diag can drive one at a time and so prod can
  call them from API/timer. (Same "expose the capability, not a forced `run()`" point as above.)
- **Size:** the FR2433 15 KB gate applies to the **prod binary**; diag (32 KB budget) carries prod-core
  + test harness and is expected to be larger — no conflict.

**Sharper still (Henrik 2026-09-29):** *"I would not treat any/much of the prod code as a distinct
codebase but rather diag as the special case on top of 'normal'."* · *"prod should just be seen as a
build target/axis."* So **prod is the "normal" baseline**, and **diag is a special-case build axis on
top of it** — prod/diag is a **build axis** (like the chip axis), NOT two separate codebases. End
state: **one codebase, two orthogonal build axes** (chip × prod/diag), over shared crates. The
foundation is `bsp` (board/hal — `crates/bsp`, already scaffolded) + `devices`; "normal" (prod)
behaviour is the baseline; diag layers the test harness on top. **Immediate blocker:** `board`/`hal`
wrongly live inside `diag/` — they move into `bsp` first, and both prod and diag build on it (de-forking
prod's parallel `hal.rs`/`i2c.rs`).

## Expanders & semantic pin identity (verbatim)

Expanders keep a **current state** on connected pins. An expander also keeps **topical identity** of
each connected pin. This allows a cluster of expanders to provide **semantic control of pins
regardless of how they connect**. Using stembus it becomes easier to iterate through hardware designs,
changing the location and connection of chips on the way.

Connected pins are identified by multiple IDs:
- **uid** — global known pin ID
- **Source chip**
- **Source chip pin**
- **Topic**
- **Topic pin**

### Topics
- T-USB 3.0 alt modes
- T-USB 2.0 alt modes
- M.2 Key B SSD
- M.2 Key E WiFi
- SoM NPU wakeful module
- Left Cam Module
- Right Cam Module
- PD Controller
- Battery charger

For each pin on the expander it defines the **topic no** and **topic pin index** that it connects to.
This allows other MCUs to **request state change without knowing the pin number** — the semantic
(topic, topic-pin) addressing rather than a physical pin number. This is the direction the pin
registry ([crates/bsp/connections.toml](crates/bsp/connections.toml)) evolves toward.
