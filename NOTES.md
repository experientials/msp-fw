# msp-fw — working notes (for future sessions)

Last updated 2026-09-01. State + next steps so we can resume after a context compaction.

## Where we are

diag is a working power-on self-test on the FR2476 LaunchPad. The I²C sensor bus is healthy and
**6 devices enumerate cleanly**. The firmware now runs a **cooperative scheduler**, samples the
RCWL radar and APDS proximity as tasks, and has a **feature-gated I²C stress mode**. All committed
on `main` (`6962636`), 1 commit ahead of `origin` (unpushed).

**Board state:** **ONE unified firmware** (no more `--features stress`) — 17.8 KB, built clean,
awaiting a flash of the menu build. Everything is a cooperative task switched at runtime via a
**button + OLED menu** (`tasks::Mode`): boots into `Post` (live self-test, unchanged), **S1** opens
the menu / backs out, **S2** cycles `POST LIVE / I2C MARGIN / I2C SOAK`, **S1** selects. Stress is
now `stress::StressTask` (bounded cooperative batches, not a blocking `-> !` runner). The
**ssd1306/embedded-graphics stack was removed** (the trim the design anticipated) — all display is
now the raw driver `ssd1306_raw.rs`; that reclaimed ~16 KB and pushed diag from ~28 KB to 17.8 KB
(now FR2433-viable). Also on board, verified earlier: boot ASCII banner; `[board]` stats (chip/rev/
die-serial from TLV 0x1A04, reads `832A`); **measured DVCC + die temp** (`adc.rs`, A13/A12, ~3.31 V
/ ~31 °C), boot + periodic `board:` line; MC6470 gravity cold-boot fix (wake-poll → Skip).
Gotchas banked: FR2xx **temp sensor needs `TSENSOREN` in PMMCTL2** (separate from `INTREFEN`);
**buttons S1=P1.6 / S2=P2.3** are a bench-silk assumption — if unresponsive, check the LaunchPad
schematic (`buttons.rs`).

### The bus today (shared eUSCI_B0, SDA=P1.2 / SCL=P1.3, one 3.3 V domain)

| Device | Addr | diag coverage |
|---|---|---|
| IS31FL3730 LED matrix | 0x60/0x61 | driver + pass/fail status display |
| SSD1306 OLED | 0x3C | driver (status display) |
| APDS-9960 | 0x39 | ID (0xAB) + proximity task (5 Hz) |
| VL53L0X ToF | 0x29 | ID only (WHO_AM_I 0xEE) |
| MC6470 eCompass | 0x4C accel + 0x0C mag | presence (see gotcha) |
| RCWL-0516 radar | P2.4 (GPIO) | motion-window task |

## Architecture added this session

- **`crates/sched`** — PAC-agnostic cooperative (run-to-completion) scheduler: `Task<C>`, `Slot`,
  `tick`. Generic over a caller context + caller-supplied `now`, so one copy serves diag / product /
  examples on FR2433/FR2476. Shared library crates now live under **`crates/`** (like `pac/`).
- **diag on the scheduler** — `main` builds a `Cx` blackboard + a task table and loops
  `sched::tick`. `clock.rs` = polled **TB0** ms time base (no ISR). Tasks: `RadarTask` (variable
  rate), `ProximityTask` (APDS), `PostTask` (~3 s POST + report). Rule: **never block in a task**;
  the WDT is the backstop (cooperative = no preemption).
- **Button + OLED menu (`tasks::ButtonTask` + `UiTask` + `Mode`)** — the unification milestone: one
  firmware, tasks switched at runtime instead of `--features`. `Post` (live self-test) is the
  default; **S1** = menu/back, **S2** = next item, **S1-in-menu** = select (`POST LIVE / I2C MARGIN
  / I2C SOAK`). Menu/status rendered with the raw `ssd1306_raw.rs` driver (5×7 font). Buttons on
  P1.6/P2.3 (bench assumption, `buttons.rs`).
- **Stress as a cooperative task (`stress::StressTask`)** — the old blocking `--features stress`
  `-> !` runner is gone; it now advances a bounded batch of *verified* reads per `poll` and yields.
  Margin sweep (100 k→1 MHz) + cumulative error-rate soak (@100 kHz operating clock); `usec.rs` =
  **TA0** µs timer (always built now). Verified reads catch bit-corruption, not just NACKs. Publishes
  progress to the blackboard for `UiTask`; still prints the full lines over UART. Spec in
  `diag/DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
- **Scheduler deadline telemetry** — always-on: `sched` tracks
  per-task `max_late` + `overruns` (from ms `now`, no hardware); `main` prints a `sched:` line every
  ~10 s. Quantifies the "task running too long" concern — the ~3 s POST hogs the loop, so radar/prox
  show that as their max-late.

## Design stance (decisions to honour)

- **Retro-diag-ROM ethos: keep diag lean.** Spirit of an Amiga/C64 diag ROM (a few KB). It's a
  bring-up/health tool, not a product.
- **Graphics stack (`ssd1306`/`embedded-graphics`) — currently trimmed, NOT a settled decision.**
  It came out to fit the unified firmware, but the "ROM ceiling" it hit was the **linker map's
  32 KB** (`diag/memory.x` ROM = 0x8000–0xFF7F), **not the chip** — the FR2476 has **64 KB FRAM**;
  the upper 32 KB (0x10000+) is unmapped. The real fix is mapping the full 64 KB (needs the large
  memory model / 20-bit addressing — msp430 Rust support TBC), after which graphics can return
  alongside everything. Graphics reduction is a "when genuinely too big" lever and **is not
  pressing** — do not treat this trim as permanent. Display functionality is intact via the raw
  `ssd1306_raw.rs` driver; new display work still uses raw I²C.
- **HAL abstraction (`hal.rs` `EusciI2c` = `embedded-hal::I2c` seam) — KEPT.** Was briefly removed
  with the graphics stack (its only consumer), but it's ~0 ROM (LTO strips the unused impl) and is
  the portability seam for `crates/devices` + product firmware. **Do not remove robustness or
  abstraction to save graphics footprint** — they're independent. Restored 2026-09-02.
- **Trimming the stack is discretionary — the timing doesn't matter either way.** Not urgent, not
  blocked on budget (we're fine at ~23.5 KB of 64 KB); do it whenever convenient. Removes ~16 KB and
  makes diag near-FR2433-viable (15.5 KB). It's cleanup, not a gate on anything.
- **End-state: one unified diag firmware**, POST + stress-type work as runtime-selectable *tasks*
  (not a build feature). Independent of the trim — a unified image fits 64 KB with or without it.
  The current `--features stress` split is a stepping stone.

## Structure direction (considered, not yet built)

- **Bag of tests.** diag's checks should be a reorderable registry — `Test { name, group, run: fn(&Cx)
  -> Outcome }`, `Outcome { Pass, Fail, Skip, Info }` — that `run()` iterates. Reorder = reorder the
  array; scripts/menu pick subsets. Realizes DESIGN's `TESTS` sketch. **Keep Tests (run-once →
  verdict) distinct from `sched::Task`s (continuous)**; the POST is a Task that runs the Test bag.
  *Do this refactor inside diag next — low risk, unblocks the button menu.*
- **Code layout.** Not everything belongs under `diag/`. Device drivers + the test framework are
  shared with the future product firmware (which needs self-test too). Target: `crates/devices`
  (drivers), `crates/board` (chip BSP: i2c/uart/timer, FR2433/FR2476 by feature), `crates/selftest`
  (Test framework); `diag/` becomes a thin binary (manifest + orchestration + stress + main).
  **Blocker/decision:** sharing drivers across chips + across diag/product needs a **bus trait seam**
  (`embedded-hal::I2c`, already half-present in `hal.rs`) — a deliberate softening of "no HAL,
  PAC-direct," justified only by the second consumer. **Defer the extraction until the product
  firmware exists (YAGNI); keep each driver a self-contained `src/<chip>.rs` now so the lift is a
  move, not a rewrite.**

## Key gotchas learned (don't relearn these)

- **6DOF IMU 13 Click (MIKROE-4228) is an mCube MC6470, NOT an ICM-42605** — DEV_BOARDS had it
  wrong. Accel+mag **eCompass**, **I²C-only (no CS/SPI)**, at TWO sub-addresses: **0x4C accel +
  0x0C mag** (both ACK the scan). If a "6DOF IMU" reads absent at 0x68, look at 0x4C/0x0C.
- **InvenSense ICM-426xx need CS tied HIGH for I²C** (a CS low edge at power-up latches SPI until
  power-cycle). Don't leave CS floating if we ever use one. (Was the wrong first theory for the MC6470
  — the "no CS pin" observation is what corrected it.)
- **RCWL-0516 radar OUT → P2.4**, chosen over P1.6 because P2.4 is port-interrupt/wake-from-LPMx.5
  capable *and* keeps the VSOM ADC pin (P1.6) free. Wired through a **2 kΩ series** resistor — caps
  any fault current (accidental output contention / back-drive through the ESD clamp) under the
  ±2 mA per-pin limit; high level still ~3.0 V after the divider with the internal pulldown.
- **MAX98357A is an I²S amp → host-side**, not the MSP430 supervisor's job (no I²S peripheral; the
  202 Combi routes I²S on the camera side). Never on the sensor bus.
- **ADXL337 rejected** — analog accel would burn 3 ADC pins for what the MC6470/ICM give digitally.
- **Stress is safe to run for days** — I²C reads are non-destructive, nothing writes
  endurance-limited memory, load is milliwatts. Bounded soak duration is for *reportability*.
- **All addresses "ACK" on a scan = SDA stuck low** (electrical), not real devices.
- **UART garbled until the DCO/FLL is set to a precise 1 MHz** (SCG0-off → set CSCTL1/2/3 → wait
  `CSCTL7 & FLLUNLOCK==0` → set CSCTL4 → settle). The "close enough" version garbles the first bytes.
- **SBW attach RESETS the chip** — `md` shows post-reset state; use breakpoints to observe running state.
- **eZ-FET exposes two CDC ports; the higher-numbered is the backchannel UART.** The numbers change
  per re-enumeration (23203 / 23601 / 23603 / …) — `just monitor` auto-picks the highest.
- **P2.0/P2.1 = 32 kHz crystal** — never GPIO. IS31 SDB is on **P2.5**; RCWL on **P2.4**.
- **msp430 inline asm needs** `#![feature(asm_experimental_arch)]` + `core::arch::asm!("bis #0x40, r2")`
  for SCG0 (SR = r2).

## FR2476 pin quick-reference (from datasheet)

- **UCB0 I²C:** SDA=P1.2, SCL=P1.3 (`P1SELx=01`, default). Alt remap: P4.5/P4.6 (SYSCFG2 USCIB0RMP).
- **UCB1 I²C:** SDA=P3.2, SCL=P3.6 (default) or P4.3/P4.4 (remapped).
- **UCA0 UART:** TX=P1.4, RX=P1.5 (`P1SELx=01`) → eZ-FET backchannel.
- **GPIO in use:** **P2.5 = IS31 SDB** (drive high to enable), **P2.4 = RCWL radar OUT** (GPIO in +
  pulldown, 2 kΩ series). Product-intent ADC: **P1.6=VSOM, P1.7=CHARGE** (`connections.toml`).
  LaunchPad (SLAU802): LED1=P1.0, TMP235=P1.1, **S1=P4.0, S2=P2.3** (NOT P1.6 — earlier silk guess
  was wrong), S3=RST, P2.0/2.1=crystal. diag uses only S1 (one-button cycle).
- SFR addresses: WDTCTL 0x01CC, PM5CTL0 0x0130, P1OUT 0x0202/DIR 0x0204/SEL0 0x020A,
  P2OUT 0x0203/DIR 0x0205/SEL0 0x020B, UCB0CTLW0 0x0540/BRW 0x0546/I2CSA 0x0560/IFG 0x056C,
  UCA0CTLW0 0x0500/BRW 0x0506/MCTLW 0x0508/IFG 0x051C, CSCTL1 0x0182/2 0x0184/3 0x0186/4 0x0188/7 0x018E.

## Rust toolchain / PAC / HAL

- One Docker image (`msp430-c-rust:local`) = msp430-gcc + pinned Rust nightly-2025-06-25 + `just`.
  `just bootstrap` builds it. Each `docker run` is a fresh container → cold `core` rebuild (~2–3 min).
- **PACs vendored** in `pac/msp430fr2476` and `pac/msp430fr2433` (svd2rust; regen via `just pac gen`).
  crates.io `msp430fr2476` is YANKED.
- **No off-the-shelf HAL for FR24xx.** Our "HAL" = thin PAC wrappers in `diag/src/{i2c,uart,...}.rs`.
  Shared logic that isn't hardware (the scheduler) lives in **`crates/sched`**. A typed-pin board/BSP
  crate is the planned next layer (see backlog — name will clash with the `board/` config dir).
- **`diag/` (PAC-based) is canonical.** `regs::dump` prints live SFRs at boot (decoded per-pin
  verdict) so we reason from ground truth, not source.

## Open items / backlog

- [ ] **Map the full 64 KB FRAM** (`diag/memory.x` ROM is only the lower 32 KB, 0x8000–0xFF7F).
      Needs the large memory model (20-bit far addressing) + split ROM regions; verify the msp430
      Rust target supports `-mlarge` and that flashing upper FRAM (0x10000+) works. **Unblocks
      restoring the graphics stack without any trim** (chose option B — defer, not rushed). Timebox
      an investigation before committing.
- [x] **MC6470**: mag WHO_AM_I + liveness DONE. Fetched the mCube datasheet (APS-048-0033v1.7);
      magnetometer (0x0C) now a shared Device `Mc6470Mag` — `identify` = "Who I am" 0x0F==0x49,
      `measure` = active/force (CTRL1 PC=1, CTRL3 FORCE) → poll STATUS.DRDY → signed-LE OUTX/Y/Z,
      0.15 µT/LSB. Verified live: `id ok  |B|=39.75uT` (plausible Earth field). Accel WHO_AM_I (§9
      chip-ID) still available to strengthen the accel `identify` beyond register-response — minor
      follow-up.
- [~] **VL53L0X**: identity + coarse ranging + approach classifier DONE in code & verified on a
      static target; live approach/recede trend UNVERIFIED (needs a proper sensor mount).
      - `crates/devices/src/vl53l0x.rs`: identity `Device` (`identify` 0xC0==0xEE); `Vl53l0xRanging`
        (stateful handle) = minimal single-shot ranging **ported from Pololu's VL53L0X lib** (faithful
        reduction of ST's API): DataInit + SPAD/ref setup + default tuning blob + ref calibration,
        then single-shot `read_range` (mm). **Deliberately SKIPS** the measurement-timing-budget recalc
        (~200 lines of Q-format timing math) — tuning defaults range fine for coarse use; accuracy is
        uncalibrated by design.
      - `RangeTracker` + `Attention` = the SUPERVISOR wake-on-approach primitive: 8-sample ring, mean
        older-half vs newer-half → Approaching / Receding / Stationary / NoTarget, plus a `near_mm`
        threshold. Integer-only.
      - Verified live on FR2476: init OK, `read_range` gives steady plausible mm (~68–90 mm on a fixed
        bench object), classifier correctly = `stationary NEAR`. **NOT yet verified:** the trend under
        motion — the bench sensor is occluded by a fixed object ~7 cm in front (single-zone ToF reports
        the nearest thing), so a hand behind it isn't seen. NEEDS a proper sensor mount aimed at open
        space to confirm APPROACHING/receding flips. (Prod console runs a ~5 s sample burst when the
        VL53L0X is present — `prod/src/enumerate.rs`.)
      - Bearing NOTE: single-zone ToF gives distance+trend but NO direction; "adjacent/passing" reads
        as a transient at ~constant range. True bearing needs a multi-zone ToF (VL53L5CX/L7CX).
- [~] **Operating modes (Passive / Sensing / TBD)** — PLAN in `prod/DESIGN.md` (canonical statement 4
      + "Operating modes"); SKELETON implemented & bench-verified. `prod/src/mode.rs`: `Mode` enum
      (cfg'd variants), `default_boot`, `ModeMachine` with the sensor-bus **acquire/release** handoff
      (→Sensing routes P1.2/3 + `i2c::init` B0 master; →Passive holds B0 in reset + tri-states pins).
      Cargo features `mode-passive`/`mode-sensing` (≥1 required — compile_error); `mode-sensing` NOT
      built for fr24xx (compile_error — Passive-only). prod.just per-family MODES default (fr247x=both,
      fr24xx=passive). Wired into run_fr247x: boot the default mode, sensor scan gated on Sensing,
      console `m` toggles mode. VERIFIED live: sensing default → `[7 found]`; passive → `(none)
      [0 found]`, `status=0x01` (BOOTED-only, honest — Passive::booted status). Sizes fr247x console:
      both 45 %, passive 44 %, sensing 44 %. **STILL OPEN (the FULL impl):** PMIC wake pin + the
      monitor CONDITIONS that raise it (the reason Sensing exists), the SoM-facing mode REGISTER for
      runtime switch (skeleton has console `m` only — can't drive it from the SoM yet), FRAM-persisted
      default (INIT_CODE), mode 3, and the transition-sequencing safety around a live master.
- [~] **eUSCI_B1 I²C-SLAVE surface (Stem bus → SoM)** — transport DONE, master-read verification
      pending. `prod/src/stem.rs`: polled eUSCI_B1 slave @ 0x20 on P3.2/P3.6, dispatches the PCA9698
      command-pointer + AI protocol onto a `RegFile`. Debug/identity window (0x30–0x3F) is REAL (via
      `status::read_reg` — same bytes as the bench dump); GPIO banks (OP/IOC/PI/MSK) are coherent
      firmware SHADOW; IP=0 and voltages=0 until the pin map + rail ADC land. Polled in both the
      console command loop and the production idle loop. Verified: builds (silent 2192 B/6 %), boots,
      sensor bus (B0/P1) unaffected, no hang. **NOT verified: a master actually reading it** — no
      master on the Stem bus.
      - CLOSE THE LOOP without the SoM: wire a **B0↔B1 loopback** (jumper P3.2→P1.2, P3.6→P1.3) — the
        slave (0x20) then appears on the sensor bus and the B0 master can read its own DBG_IFACE
        (0x30 → 0xD0), build id, etc. Could add a firmware self-test that triggers when 0x20 shows in
        the scan. (Needs 2 jumper wires on the LaunchPad.)
      - FOLLOW-UPS: physical GPIO backing (bank↔port pin map in `model::PinMap`); rail-ADC voltages
        (0x2C/0x2D); STEM-MSG/INT notification side; confirm 0x20 vs I2C-API.md canonical address and
        the CMD_AI bit position (regmap.rs TODO).
- [~] **Benchmark/build against FR2155/FR2355 (production dual-I²C parts)** (Henrik, 2026-09-24).
      DONE: every `just prod build fr247x` now ALSO benchmarks the image against the production budget
      **FR2155/FR2355 = 32 KB FRAM / 4 KB SRAM** (informational, in `prod.just` finish()). KEY: the
      FR2476 dev board has **8 KB SRAM but the shipped FR2155 has only 4 KB** (half) — the dev gate
      alone would miss an SRAM overflow that bricks production. Current image fits easily (2 B SRAM).
      Figures cited from `docs/MCU_SELECTION.md`: FR2155 32K/4K (baseline, ~95 LCSC), FR2355 32K/4K
      (SAC, the **MSP-EXP430FR2355 dev LaunchPad** = strict superset to develop FR2155 on), FR2153/
      FR2353 = 16K/2K cheaper alts.
      TODO — make **fr215x a real COMPILE target** (`just prod build fr215x`):
      - [x] **FR2155 + FR2355 PACs generated** (2026-09-24, `just pac gen msp430fr2155 msp430fr2355`)
        → vendored `pac/msp430fr2155` + `pac/msp430fr2355`, compile-tested (`just pac check`). Both
        confirmed dual-I²C (E_USCI_B0/B1) + dual eComp (E_COMP0/1); FR2355 adds SAC0..3.
      - [ ] `memory-fr215x.x` (32 KB FRAM / 4 KB SRAM origins).
      - [ ] model detection for the FR2155/FR2355 TLV device IDs (`model.rs`) — read the actual IDs
        from the PAC TLV / a datasheet.
      - [ ] family-cfg the hal/i2c/clock/stem for `fr215x` (add a `fr215x` feature + optional PAC dep;
        the peripheral API matches FR2476 closely — E_USCI_B0/B1, ports — so cfg reuse should be high).
      - [ ] prod.just family case `fr215x) 32768/4096` + MODES=both (`mode-sensing` allowed — dual-I²C).
      No longer blocked on the SVD/PAC — remaining is the family-cfg wiring; a dev board only needed
      for on-hardware sign-off.
- [ ] **Firmware version must be reportable by inspecting the MSP** (Henrik, 2026-09-24). A register
      that a bus master can read to get the firmware version, AND — when console logging is on — the
      boot banner shows the firmware version number.
      - What EXISTS today: boot console prints the full build stamp (`PROD_BUILD`/`DIAG_BUILD`, e.g.
        `fr2476/2026.dev-ac40511-dirty.<secs>`); debug regs `0x33–0x36` hold a 32-bit **FNV build-id**
        (a hash of that stamp), currently console-visible via the `d` dump.
      - GAPS to close: (1) the register value is a *hash*, not a human **version number** — decide
        the scheme (semantic `PROD_RELEASE` semver, or a monotonic version int) and expose it in a
        dedicated, documented register (e.g. a `DBG_VERSION`/`FW_VERSION` field, stable across the
        family). (2) The build-id/version is only console-readable until the **eUSCI_B1 I²C-slave
        surface** is wired — "inspect the MSP over the bus" depends on that. (3) Console boot should
        print a clean version number (not only the dev build stamp) when a real release is set.
      - IDEA (Henrik, 2026-09-24): in **prod**, if an OLED is connected (SSD1306 @0x3C), **show the
        version number on it for ~5 s at boot** — a human-readable version surface with no console or
        bus master needed. Reuse diag's `ssd1306_raw.rs` (port into `crates/devices` as a shared
        display driver, consistent with the per-device convention).
- [ ] **Rail ADC** (VSOM P1.6 / CHARGE P1.7) + thresholds — the supervisor's core health check;
      also unlocks the thermal/power stress rung.
- [ ] **Prove one wake-on-event source** (RCWL P2.4 port interrupt, or a sensor INT) — the
      supervisor's reason to exist; currently unproven.
- [ ] **Config-drift**: per-product expected-device manifest (`board/devices.toml`) →
      report missing/unexpected (DESIGN objective 2).
- [ ] **Scheduler deadline-miss instrumentation** (the µs timer is already in place).
- [ ] **Thermal/power-under-load stress rung** (needs rail ADC; watch OLED burn-in if driving outputs).
- [ ] Sync `diag/README` coverage/layout for APDS/MC6470 (partially done).
- [ ] **board crate** (typed pins): will want `crates/board`, which clashes with the `board/` config
      dir — reconcile when it lands.
- [ ] APDS INT wiring for interrupt-driven gesture/proximity (polled for now).
- [ ] Wire `examples/*` onto `crates/sched`.
- [ ] `connections.toml` package field `RHB VQFN-40` — confirm the real bob-929 package.
- [ ] Verify **FR2433** I²C pins from *its* datasheet before trusting P1.2/P1.3 there.
- [ ] Push `main` to origin (1 commit ahead) when ready.
