#![no_std]

//! Cooperative, run-to-completion task scheduler for msp-fw.
//!
//! The model: there is one stack and no preemption. Each task's [`Task::poll`] runs **one short,
//! non-blocking step** and returns; the scheduler calls it again when its next period is due.
//! Anything that would "wait" (an I²C reply, an animation frame delay, a comms ACK) becomes a
//! *state held in the task*, not a spin — so N concerns interleave over time on a 1 MHz MCU
//! without threads, an allocator, or an RTOS.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately **hardware-agnostic**. It never references a PAC, a timer, or a
//! chip: the caller owns those, passes its own context `C` (peripherals + a cross-task
//! blackboard) into every `poll`, and passes the current time (`now`, monotonic milliseconds)
//! into [`tick`]. That keeps one copy of the scheduler correct for FR2433, FR2476, the examples,
//! and host unit tests — matching the repo's "must not depend on FR2476-only features" and
//! "no HAL" conventions.
//!
//! # Contract
//! - **Never block in `poll`.** A task that spins stalls *every* other task (no preemption). The
//!   hardware watchdog is the backstop for a task that violates this; it is not a licence to block.
//! - **Private vs shared state.** A task's own bookkeeping lives in `self` (`&mut self`). State
//!   two tasks share (e.g. one produces a reading another consumes) lives in the context `C` —
//!   the explicit, typed blackboard — never in globals.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```ignore
//! struct Cx<'a> { p: &'a Peripherals, motion: bool }
//! struct Sampler { prev: bool }
//! impl<'a> sched::Task<Cx<'a>> for Sampler {
//!     fn poll(&mut self, cx: &mut Cx<'a>, _now: u32) -> Option<u32> {
//!         cx.motion = read_pin(cx.p);          // publish to the blackboard
//!         Some(if cx.motion { 5 } else { 50 }) // variable cadence: fast when active
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut s = Sampler { prev: false };
//! let mut slots = [sched::Slot::every(50, &mut s)];
//! loop {
//!     let now = clock.now_ms();               // caller's time base
//!     sched::tick(&mut slots, &mut cx, now);
//! }
//! ```
