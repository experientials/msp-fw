#![no_std]
//! Shared per-device drivers for the bob-929 Stem — the "nervous system" sensor library.
//!
//! **One module per device**, each behind the standard [`Device`] convention and **generic over
//! `embedded_hal::i2c::I2c`**, so diag (identify / self-test) and prod (measure / report) — on ANY
//! MCU family — consume the SAME driver instead of forking per-sensor code. The per-family bus impl
//! (the `embedded-hal` I2c over eUSCI_B, e.g. `diag/src/hal.rs`) is the only chip-specific piece;
//! everything here is portable. This is the foundation of the stem firmware library.
//!
//! Two consumers, one driver:
//!   • **diag** — enumerate the bus ([`present`] + [`KNOWN`]) and verify identity ([`Device::identify`],
//!     [`Device::self_test`]).
//!   • **prod** — read/report state on demand ([`Device::measure`]).
