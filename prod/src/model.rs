//! Runtime MSP430 model detection + pin mapping — the seam that lets **one image cover a whole
//! register-/memory-map-compatible family** (see DESIGN.md "Permutation strategy"). The compiled
//! family is chosen by the Cargo family feature (`fr247x` default = FR2476/FR2475 dual-I²C; `fr24xx`
//! = FR2433 single-I²C); FR215x (FR2155) is a future family. `detect()` reads the Device ID at
//! runtime and `matches_build_family()` catches a wrong-family flash.
//!
//! Detection is datasheet-grounded; the model table + pin maps stay thin until the BOM/bring-up fills them.

#![allow(dead_code)] // Seam consumed incrementally as bring-up lands.
