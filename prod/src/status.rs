//! Debug / identity / status — the state model behind the `regmap` debug window (0x30–0x3F).
//!
//! ONE model, TWO readers: [`Status::read_reg`] is the single source the eUSCI_B1 I2C-slave ISR
//! (the SoM, later) and the bench [`Status::dump`] (UART, `console`-gated) both read — so the SoM and
//! the bench see identical bytes. The model + `read_reg` are ALWAYS built (they feed the I2C-slave
//! surface); only the UART dump is `console`-gated. Populated from the sensor-bus enumeration + the
//! compiled build stamp + the detected model. Additive to the PCA9698 facade (nothing touches 0x00–0x2A).

#![allow(dead_code)] // some fields/paths serve the SoM's I2C-slave reads (stem::RegFile) not the bench dump.
