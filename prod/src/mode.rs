//! Operating modes (DESIGN.md "Operating modes") — SKELETON.
//!
//! A build compiles in the modes it supports (`mode-passive` / `mode-sensing` features); the active
//! mode is a **runtime switch** among them. The B1 slave surface (`stem.rs`) runs in EVERY mode —
//! modes change only the **sensor-bus** behaviour. Switching is an ACTION, not just a flag:
//!   • **→ Sensing**: acquire the sensor bus (bring up eUSCI_B0 as master), then monitor.
//!   • **→ Passive**: release the sensor bus (hold B0 in reset, tri-state its pins) so the SoM owns it.
//!
//! What's scaffolded here: the mode set, the boot default, and the transition machinery with the
//! bus **acquire/release** handoff. What's still open (DESIGN.md): the PMIC wake signal + the
//! monitor CONDITIONS that raise it, the SoM-facing mode register, and FRAM persistence of the default.

#![allow(dead_code)] // some paths are unused depending on which mode features are compiled in.
